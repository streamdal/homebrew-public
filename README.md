Streamdal Homebrew
==================

These formulae are made available via Streamdal's public homebrew tap.

To install:

```bash
$ brew tap streamdal/public
$ brew install <package>
```

If `<package>` conflicts with another package (public or from another tap),
install the _specific_ package by running: 

```bash
$ brew install streamdal/public/<package>
```
